//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, 
//and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have
// anything specific to write because your programs are too 
//simple at this point, just add your name and the current
// date at the top of each program file. 
//Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
